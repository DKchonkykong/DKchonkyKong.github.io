            <p> Hello there, I'm a fellow by the name of DKchonkykong or you might know me as BANG on discord. I'm a university undergrad currently studing games for programming and also doing other stuff like: photography and 3D modeling
              to name a few. Main languages I use for programming is C#, and some Python.

                Before I decided to study game dev I was a musician playing classical and jazz on my clarinet and piano.
