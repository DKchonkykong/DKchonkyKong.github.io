            <h1>Photo Camera</h1>
            
            <p>  This is also another hobby I do which is to film and shoot photos!
            </p>
          Ever since I was young I always liked taking photos of random stuff and now posting my new photos to instagram.
          Recently getting a new professional camera it made it way better for my ameature photography skills.
            <p>
              These are some images I took from both the UK and Romania. 
            </p>
            <p> (more photos and other small tidbits maybe?) Anyway this is one of the more physical hobbies I have and I hope you liked the photos I took and how I managed to edit them!
